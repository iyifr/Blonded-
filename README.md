# music-player
A music player built with Javascript, HTML and CSS <br>
I watched a tutorial on youtube where a music player was built without a js Framework. So i decided to go crazy with it and i made a music player that will play one of the
greatest albums of all time, Frank Ocean's 'Blonde'. I built this in a few hours and it was really fun to make. Part of perfecting jS is taking on different types of projects you enjoy.
It makes coding really fun. I'm (obviously) a massive Frank Ocean fan so...:)
